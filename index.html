      <h1>FORMULA ONE</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="about">
      <h1>What is Formula one</h4>
        <p> Formula 1 is one of the fastest and most exciting sports in the world.
          Drivers race powerful cars on challenging tracks across the globe,
          reaching incredible speeds while testing their skill and focus.
          Every race is full of strategy, risk, and adrenaline, as drivers compete to win the championship.
          Fans watch eagerly as every corner, overtake, and pit stop can change the outcome in an instant.
          It’s a sport where precision meets passion, and every second matters.
        </p>

        <h1>The season</h1>
        <p>A Formula 1 season is made up of races all over the world called Grands Prix. 
          Drivers and teams collect points in every race, and at the end, 
          the best driver wins the Drivers’ Championship while the best team wins the Constructors’ Championship.</p>

        <h1>The Cars</h1>
        <p>F1 cars are tiny, super-powerful single-seaters that can reach insane speeds. 
          They’re built to go fast while staying safe and precise on the track. 
          Teams are always working to make them faster and better, 
          adjusting everything from the tires to the shape of the car. Driving one takes incredible skill, 
          and even small mistakes at high speed can make a big difference.</p>
          <h3>DRS (drag reduction system)</h3>
          <p>DRS is a special feature on F1 cars that helps drivers go faster on straight parts of the track. 
            It opens a flap on the rear wing to reduce air resistance, making it easier to overtake another car. 
            Drivers can only use it in certain zones during the race.</p>

        <h1>Race Weekend</h1>
        <h3>Practice</h3>
        <p>The race weekend starts with practice sessions where drivers get familiar with the track and test their cars. 
          They try out different setups, tires, and lines to see what works best. 
          It’s a time for teams to gather data and make adjustments so the car is ready for the real challenge.</p>
        <h3>Qualifying</h3>
        <p>Next comes qualifying, which decides the starting order for the race. 
          Drivers push their cars to the limit to set the fastest lap time, 
          and the quickest driver earns pole position, starting at the very front. 
          Every fraction of a second matters, because starting at the front makes it easier to lead the race.</p>
        <h3>The Race</h3>
        <p>Finally, the main race tests drivers like nothing else. 
          They compete wheel-to-wheel, overtaking rivals, managing tires, 
          and keeping control at extreme speeds. Every turn, pit stop, and strategy decision can change the outcome, 
          and the driver who stays focused and fast from start to finish has the best chance of winning.</p>

        <h1>Scoring</h1>
        <p>Points are given to the top 10 finishers in each race, with first place earning the most. 
          There’s also a bonus point for the fastest lap if the driver finishes in the top 10. 
          Over the season, these points add up, deciding who becomes the champion driver and which team takes the Constructors’ 
          Championship. Every point counts, and even small mistakes can cost crucial positions.</p>

        <h1>Strategy</h1>
        <p>Winning in Formula 1 isn’t just about driving fast—it’s also about smart decisions. 
          Teams plan pit stops, tire choices, and overtaking moves carefully. Weather changes, crashes, 
          and even safety cars can shake up the race, so drivers and teams have to think quickly and adjust on the fly. 
          Strategy can make the difference between winning and losing by mere milli seconds.</p>
